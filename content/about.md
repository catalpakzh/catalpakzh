This is Kang Zihao, without an English name, hope that one day I can find a adaptable name. I was born in Taihe, Jiangxi province. Currently, I am a master's student at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (<span style="border-bottom:1px dashed;">Thanks for my family's support</span>), majoring in Energy and Environment. I earned my bachelor's degree in Ecology from [South China Agricultural University](https://www.scau.edu.cn/) in 2023. After Graduation, I worked at the BYD as an procurement engineer for one year. It is a not good experience for me. Therefore, I applied for the master degree provided by CityU. Now, I am positive looking for the opportunity to study for a PhD.

This website is created for me to record the story I am making up. 

**Good luck to me !**
