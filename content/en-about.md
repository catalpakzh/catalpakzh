This website is built with blogdown, a R package developed by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/), and the theme is [hugo-ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). If you also want to create a personal website, you can check out yihui's website as reference. While the website of [Jingji Pang](https://jinjipang.com/) also gives me a lot of inspiration, you can also check out her website.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Ecology from South China Agricultural University in 2023. Currently, I am a master's student at City University of Hong Kong, majoring in Energy and Environment. I am positively finding an opportunity to study for a PhD.
